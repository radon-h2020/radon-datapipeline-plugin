Designing data pipelines using Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard language enables the ability to easily compose data driven applications from reusable, independently deployable, schedulable and scalable pipeline tasks, such as microservices, serverless functions or self-contained applications.

The aim is to provide standards based methodology and tools for contolling the life-cycle of such composable data pipelines in a DevOps manner and to enable companies to move from monolithic data management applications to freely reusable, composable, and data pipeline services.
