Designing data pipelines using Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard language enables the ability to easily compose data driven applications from reusable, independently deployable, schedulable and scalable pipeline tasks, such as microservices, serverless functions or self-contained applications.

The aim is to enable data engineers to move from monolithic data management applications to freely composable, portable and reusable data pipelines consisting of serverless functions or  microservices by providing a standards based methodology and tools for contolling the life-cycle of such composable data pipelines.
