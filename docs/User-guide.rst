In this section, you will see how to design a service template using data pipeline nodes. With the current version of TOSCA based data pipeline node types, user can not create a connection with other non-data pipeline TOSCA nodes. The TOSCA data pipeline nodes can be found in `RADON particle <https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles>`_ GitHub repository.


To illustrate the design process, let consider an use case of synchronising AWS S3 bucket and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

***********
Users can user RADON IDE, to design a service template in data pipeline apparoche.
