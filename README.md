# radon-datapipeline-plugin
A plugin to make the TOSCA-based data pipeline service blueprint workable.  

This plugin aims to handle the TOSCA CSAR file, which is generated by RADON Graphical Modeling Tool (GMT), to make it executable by the RADON-orchestrator. While doing so, this plugin updates the service blueprint based on the artifacts of the user-created TOSCA nodes. 

## Where is this plugin in RADON-Architecture?
We can realized this plugin in the path of RADON Graphical Modeling Tool to RADON Orchestrator. Hence, the input to this plugin is the user-created TOSCA service blueprint (i.e. CSAR file) from GMT and the output the updated CSAR file to the RADON Orchestrator.

## How does the plugin work?
- This plugin unzip the CSAR file to access the service blueprint (YAML file).
- Parses the the YAML file to understand the node topolology.
- Modifies the service file itself, if needed.
- Updates the templates, if needed.
- Zip again all the files to create the CSAR file.
- Returns the CSAR file, which can then be passed as input to the RADON Orchestrator.

This is the initial version of the Data pipeline plugin. In the proceeding versions, the plugin will be improved with additional features. 

## How to use the plugin as a stand alone tool?
- Download the plugin github repository using git or as a zip file. 
- Make sure that Python environment is working on your machine.
- Keep your TOSCA service ready and note the path. 
- In this version of the Plugin, YAML file is expected as input.
- Execute the following command
```
python DPP_V1 <path to the yaml file>  
```
- Output will be placed in the current directory.

## How to use the plugin API?

Web service version of the plugin is available in the datapipeline-server folder

Download the github project repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-datapipeline-plugin
cd radon-datapipeline-plugin
```

User Docker to build and deploy the data pipeline plugin webservice:
```bash
cd  datapipeline-server

# building the image
docker build -t radon_dpp_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 adon_dpp_server
```
